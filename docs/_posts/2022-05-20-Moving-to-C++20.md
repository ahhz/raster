The C++20 STL includes the long awaited STL Range library as well as significant updates to the Iterator library. These are highly useful for the Pronto Raster library and from now on the minimal supported C++ version will be C++20. The code will be gradually updated, with the following benefits:
- clearer and more accurate concepts for Rasters, Ranges and Iterators
- code simplifications, improved maintenance
- minor performance benefits
- compatibility with std::range algorithms
- No more dependancy on the Boost library

    <td>The Pronto Raster Library is a C++ library to work with raster data. The core idea of the library is to make raster data accessible following the Range concept, making it possible to work with them using standard and modern C++ idioms. The library makes it straightforward to implement Map Algebra operations, including Moving Window analysis.</td>

The library requires the following:
- C++20 (especially for the Range and Iterator libraries)
- GDAL (for accessing GIS raster data)

See the [full documentation](./docs/raster.md) for details. Or try the new [website](http://ahhz.github.io/raster/) (still maturing)

This library was previously called Blink Raster, but it is now renamed to avoid any confusion with the Chromium Blink library.
